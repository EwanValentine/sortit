# Sort it

A selection of sorting algorithms implemented in Rust. For educational purposes only. 

Some taken from: https://youtu.be/K7v4EysI0kg 

Some from copying from other languages, and applying Rust's idioms as an exercise for learning both Rust, and the various algos!

**Note: I doubt you would, but just in case... don't use these**

## Algos used

### Bubble Sort

Worst/average case: O(n2)
Best case: O(n)

### Selection Sort

### Quick Sort
Best case: O(1)
Average case: O(n log n)
Worst case: O(n2)
